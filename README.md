## Running the Project Locally
To run the code on localhost the following is what you need to do to get it running:

* Clone this repository
* Navigate into the project directory ```cd repository-name```
* Run ```npm install``` 
* When dependencies are installed, run ```npm run dev``` 
* The server will be running on http://localhost:5173/ unless your IDE specifies otherwise.

## Change number of rows and columns

* Go to /src folder
* Open ```config.ts``` and change the constants `NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS` and `NUMBER_OF_ROWS`
